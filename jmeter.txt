There are many ways you can push for the results. This is CLI way:

STEPS: 1. download the latest jmeter version

Extract in your desired directory. For example, extract to /tmp/
Now, default output file format will be csv. No need to change anything or specify in the CLI command.
Save jmx file from UI console. Say, you have saved on examples directory for example:
Now, Run the command from CLI console: jmeter -n -t examples/test.jmx -l examples/output.csv
#
Now, if you want to change the default format, check the following parameter in jmeter.properties file: jmeter.save.saveservice.output_format=xml

Now if you run the command, ./jmeter -n -t examples/test.jmx -l examples/output.jtl output get stored in xml format.

Now, make the request on multiple server(Additional info query for good knowledge): We can specify host and port as argument/tags in CLI command

./jmeter -n -t examples/test.jmx -l examples/output.csv -JHOST=<HOST> -JPORT=<PORT>
